<H2>Hello there ðŸ‘‹</H2>

Hello, my name is Boldea Marius, and my passion lies in becoming a generalist programmer for games. From a young age, I found great joy in solving puzzles and the satisfaction that comes with unraveling complex challenges. As I grew older, my affinity for math and programming deepened, fueling my ambition to pursue a career in game development. I am driven by the opportunity to combine my problem-solving skills, love for mathematics, and programming expertise to create immersive gaming experiences. My goal is to contribute to the dynamic world of game development as a versatile and skilled generalist programmer.
